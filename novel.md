Hi, I'm Alex and I'm a Software Engineer and instructor who loves to code and teach people.

I found my way into programming when I was at school. I first had real struggle to learn all the 
intricacies of programming and honestly didn't liked the idea of ME being a programmer.

It was still a Nerd thing back then! I didn't want to be a nerd! 

I wanted a girlfriend, and they didn't like nerds!

Luckily I stayed consistent and took the route and learned programming.

And moreover, thanks to the Big Bang Theory, it was suddenly cool to to be a nerd!
